AWS Machine learning services like AWS Comprehend, Translate, Transcribe, Rekognition and Polly with Python Boto3
Natural Language processing and Computer Vision are indispensable domain in Artificial Intelligence, NLP that helps machine understand, interpret, manipulate and respond to human language whereas Computer Vision helps in extraction of information and insights from an images and videos.

In this course, you will learn about Natural language processing & Computer Vision and it's application with the help of AWS Comprehend, Translate, Transcribe, Rekognition and Polly.

What is AWS Comprehend ?

Amazon Comprehend is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to identify the language of the text, extract key phrases, places, people, brands, or events, understand sentiment about products or services, and identify the main topics from a library of documents.

What is AWS Translate ?

Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service that enables to translate between a source language and a target language .

What is AWS Transcribe ?

AWS transcribe service that helps to add speech to text functionality into the applications.

What is AWS Polly ?

Amazon Textract is a machine learning (ML) service that transform text into human voice.

What is AWS Rekognition?

Amazon Rekognition is a service that makes it easy to add powerful visual analysis to your applications. Rekognition Image lets you easily build powerful applications to search, verify, and organize millions of images. Rekognition Video lets you extract motion-based context from stored or live stream videos and helps you analyze them.

Enrol in the course by going to this link-[Learn Computer Vision and NLP with AWS ML and Python Boto3](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-vision-and-nlp-with-aws-machine-learning-and-python-boto3/) Then you can come back here to download the repository. This repository contains the code that we develop in each section of the course. If you are familiar with Git, you can use Git to download it. Otherwise, you can download it as a zip file:

Next, start taking the course at the beginning! You can use the downloaded code files to support you while you go through the course.

I also strongly recommend you code while you take the course. A good strategy is:

Watch the video intently, optionally while taking notes.
Watch again, more quickly, while typing the code together with me.
Once you're done with the video, play about with the code. Make changes, break things, then fix them, and try to thoroughly understand everything the code does.
If you do this for the entire course, I guarantee you will learn how to make REST APIs using Flask and Python well and quickly.
